# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

My goals included:
 Creating a functional Work Day Scheduler
 using JavaScrip, Jquery, HTML, and CSS.  I attempted to design the code with the following acceptance criteria:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist



This project was also exceptionally difficult for me using JavaScript and JQuery. I understand the concepts during class and when I see something it makes sense however, doing it on my own is far more challenging. I got lost several times and used google as a reference but it was of little help. I also used  youtube and a tutor session to try and make this project functional. I specifically had issues with the local storage and color-coding requirements.
